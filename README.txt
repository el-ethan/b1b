Instructions for Mac OS X users:

To open the app initially:

1. If you are using a mouse with right and left buttons, right-click on the b1b icon; otherwise, press and hold the control key and click on the icon (to bring up the context menu). 
2. From the context menu click 'Open'. You will see a warning that the application is from an unrecognized developer (me). 
3. Click the 'Open' button and the app should open. After opening the app this way the first time, you should be able to open the app simply by double-clicking its icon in the future.
4. If 'b1b' displays in the top left of your menu bar, but you still do not see the window for the app, double click the icon for the app again (in the dock or in the folder).
 
NOTE: If you try to open the app by double-clicking without following these steps first, it will likely not open.

Notes on using the app:

* The app does not currently support MAC OS X Chinese input methods, so you must input text by pasting it. 
* Once you have pasted new text into the entry box, click 'Show' to refresh the display. 
* Although you can enter an arbitrarily long string of characters into the entry box, the display will grow too large to be useful with too many characters, so it is best to limit your entry to A MAX OF 4 CHARACTERS at a time.
* You can mix Simplified and Traditional characters in your input if you wish.
* Use the buttons on the top right to customize the display for a particular type of characters. Traditional and Simplified will display together by default.
* Hover the mouse arrow over characters to display their font information in the gray bar below the text entry box.
* Depending on your version of OS X, you may have fewer/more Chinese system fonts than the app was intended to be used with, so it is normal if some of the cells in the character display area are blank.
